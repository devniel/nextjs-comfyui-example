# Next.js + ComfyUI client

An example of a project calling ComfyUI via websockets using https://github.com/StableCanvas/comfyui-client.

For my `doodle` project: 

- https://github.com/devniel/doodle-bg.labs

It requires a local comfyui server with some custom nodes which I will upload later as a docker image.

## TODO

- Replace logs by `debug`.
- Containerize the app.
- Deploy using Runpod.
- Update UI.
- Replace or contribute to comfyui-client.
- Complete with the complex workflow (doodles are only for background).
